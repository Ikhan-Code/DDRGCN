# 🔒 GTransaction: Graph-Based Synthetic Identity Detection

> 🚧 This repository is currently under **peer review** for journal publication.

## 📘 About the Project

**GDDRGCN** is a multi-edge graph learning framework designed for detecting **synthetic identities** using relational, transactional, and PII-based features. It leverages **Realtional Graph Convolutional Networks (RGcN)**  with distance encoding and multi-relation modeling for enhanced performance on imbalanced fraud datasets.

🧠 The framework has been tested on large-scale identity graphs and shows promising results with strategic node selection, robust class-imbalance handling, and interpretable metrics like F1, AUC, and PR-AUC.

## 📅 Public Release Timeline

We are currently finalizing the manuscript for publication. The full codebase (including preprocessing scripts, training pipelines, and experiment logs) will be made available **after acceptance**.

⏳ **Expected Public Release**: Q4 2025

## 🔎 Features (Coming Soon)

- Multi-edge graph generation from identity and transaction data  
- Strategic distance encoding using central node heuristics  
- Robust DDRGCN training on imbalanced fraud datasets  
- Evaluation metrics with plots and benchmarking  
- Reproducible experiments and documentation
